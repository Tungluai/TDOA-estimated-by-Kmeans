# TDOA-estimated-by-Kmeans
To estimate TDOA  by Kmeans , and then use the LCMV-GSC to do speech enhancement or BSS.
This idea raises when I was learning Kmeans in ML.Then I realized Kmeans can be used to classify TDOAs in non-overlapped frequency.
There maybe some bugs in this code,and there are many improvements on both code and algrithem could be done.
If u think it's useful,please refer me.
